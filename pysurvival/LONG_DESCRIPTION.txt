PySurvival provides a very easy way to navigate between theoretical knowledge on Survival Analysis and detailed tutorials on how to conduct a full analysis, build and use a model. Indeed, the package contains:

  - 10+ models ranging from the Cox Proportional Hazard model, the Neural Multi-Task Logistic Regression to Random Survival Forest
  - Summaries of the theory behind each model as well as API descriptions and examples.
  - Tutorials displaying in great details how to perform exploratory data analysis, survival modeling, cross-validation and prediction, for churn modeling and credit risk to name a few.
  - Performance metrics to assess the models' abilities like c-index or brier score
  - Simple ways to load and save models
  - ... and more !
